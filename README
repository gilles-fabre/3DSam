3DSam is a Java 3D Physics Model Engine and Editor

	All you need is Eclipse and a properly installed JDK.
	Feel free to use, modify, extend, etc as long as you stick to the
	LGPL licence.
		
Left to do (* == completed):

*	Copy masses attributes
*	Select connection set
*	Name connection set
*	Pick named collection set
~	Hard springs (impossible; can't use a floodfill approach -as we do- for this)
*	Zoom doesn't actually change the model size (must apply new size)	
*	Model home follows model movement (make further rotations easier)
*	Bring model back to world center when gone too far
*	Rotate 45Â° around X, Y, Z buttons
*	Move Toolbar checkboxes to the menu
*	Undo/Redo ~ When a change is made, the remaining part of history is discarded
*	Non modal "Model Parts" dialog
*	Better Selection (bounding rect)
*	Serialization/Deserialization used to forget springs connectionSets. 
*	Fix selection manipulation (looks like the delta increases with the distance 
		to the center of the screen)
	 	rebuild if broken after reloading a model.
*	Arrows to move up/down/left/right the selected sliders
* 	Ctrl + select/drag add to the selection
* 	Make Cone base more rigid  
*   Weld selected masses
*	Prevent window from closing ig project dirty and unsaved
*	Use a different color for the spring/mass currently under the mouse
*	Copy/Paste springs attributes
*	Settings for x,y,z eye distance (GROUND_MIN <> GROUND_MAX)
	Add align (center of) selected masses on X, on Y, on Z
	Fix spring selection problem (probably has to do with the 'frontmost' stuff)
